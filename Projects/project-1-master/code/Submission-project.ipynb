Your solution should map all column names being changed at once (no repeated singular name-changes). **We will be combining these data with some of the data from 2018, and so you should name columns in an appropriate way**.\n",

    "- Column names should be all lowercase (you will thank yourself when you start pushing data to SQL later in the course)\n",
    "- Column names should not contain spaces (underscores will suffice--this allows for using the `df.column_name` method to access columns in addition to `df['column_name']`.\n",
