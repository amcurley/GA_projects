# Using Social Media to Map Potential Power Outages

**Authors:** Aidan Curley, Bill Fu, David Lee, Nathan Seither

## Problem Statement  

During a disaster, residential areas often experience massive power outages, that in many cases last for days. Traditional methods to map power outages include live feeds and data that is provided by major utility companies as well as on satellite data that capture the extent of light emitted at night. Our tool will utilize a Twitter bot we created to stream live tweets about power outages and if the tweet is actually about a power outage we will map that users location. We will determine if a tweet is actually about a power outage using a multilayered prediciton model. If each step of the multilayered prediciton model classifies the tweet as a 1 we will 

## Requirements
Here we will write what they need to have installed to run this code.

- Windows, Linux, and MacOS are supported. ?

## Executive Summary

When finding potential locations of power outages we wanted to make sure we can grab live data.
